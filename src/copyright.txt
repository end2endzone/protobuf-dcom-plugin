// PURPOSE:
//  
//  The blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah protobuf-dcom-plugin library is used when an application has to launch another one.
//  It includes arguments and command line encoder/decoder (codecs) that are
//  designed for the purpose of helping a developper in this situation. The
//  libArgvCodec library is designed to avoid typical encoding and decoding pitfalls
//  when transferring local variable values to other application through command
//  line arguments.
//
// HISTORY:
// xx/xx/2017 v1.0 - Initial release.
